    "Imagine you have a dataset containing information about customer purchases in a grocery store. Each entry in the dataset represents a transaction, and the features include items purchased and their quantities. With unsupervised learning, you could use clustering algorithms like k-means to group similar transactions together based on the items purchased. This could help the store identify patterns in customer behavior, such as which items are frequently purchased together or which groups of customers tend to buy similar products. This unsupervised learning approach doesn't rely on labeled data; instead, it uncovers hidden structures or patterns within the data itself."
